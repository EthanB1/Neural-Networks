### Venture Funding with Deep Learning
I  work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
The business team has given me a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Steps: 


1. Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.


2. Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.


3. Optimize the neural network model.


 4. Save and export model to an HDF5 file, and name the file AlphabetSoup.h5.
